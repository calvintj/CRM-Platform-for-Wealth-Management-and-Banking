## 2. Tech Stack Details

**PERN Stack Components:**

- **PostgreSQL:**  
  Acts as the relational database management system, storing all customer data, transaction logs, and system records in a structured format.

- **Express:**  
  Serves as the backend framework that handles API routing, middleware, and server-side logic for processing requests and responses.

- **React:**  
  Powers the frontend, creating a dynamic and responsive user interface for dashboards, customer profiles, task management, and more.

- **Node:**  
  Provides the runtime environment to execute JavaScript on the server, bridging the gap between Express and React and ensuring smooth operation of the entire application.

**Tailwind CSS:**  
Used for rapidly developing a modern, responsive, and visually consistent UI with pre-defined utility classes, making the styling process both efficient and scalable.

### Example: Fetching Customer Data in React

Here's a basic example of how you might call an API endpoint to retrieve customer data:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function CustomerList() {
  const [customers, setCustomers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/customers')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setCustomers(data))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching customer data:', error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Customer List</h2>
      <ul>
        {customers.map(customer => (
          <li key={customer.id}>{customer.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CustomerList;
```

This snippet demonstrates a basic React component that fetches customer data from the backend and renders a list.
